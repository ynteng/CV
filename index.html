<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to GitHub Pages.</h3>

<p>I am an undergraduate student of <a href="http://www.is.bupt.cn/">International School</a> supported by <a href="http://www.qmul.ac.uk/">Queen Mary, University of London</a> at <a href="http://english.bupt.edu.cn/">Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications</a> (BUPT), and BUPT's computer science on the <a href="http://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/beijing-university-posts-and-telecommunications-502130">top 80</a> list of the world of US News.</p>

<p>I am a self-motivated student with research experience in laboratory and a solid background in programming. My research interests include but not limit to: data mining, recommendation system, privacy issue, social network, incentive strategy, and participant selection strategy of participatory sensing. <strong>I believe that it is worthwhile to spend additional years to get a Ph.D. degree and I am curious about the new technologies, and willing to learn them.</strong> Followings is my CV and you can also download one in <a href="">PDF</a> format.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>
<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
