{"name":"Yining Teng","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nI am an undergraduate student of [International School](http://www.is.bupt.cn/) supported by [Queen Mary, University of London](http://www.qmul.ac.uk/) at [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](http://english.bupt.edu.cn/) (BUPT). According to US News, BUPT's computer science is on the [top 80](http://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/beijing-university-posts-and-telecommunications-502130) list of the world.\r\n\r\nI am a self-motivated student with research experience in laboratory and a solid background in programming. My research interests include but not limit to: data mining, machine learning, recommendation system, privacy issue, social network, incentive strategy, and participatory sensing. **I believe that it is worthwhile to spend additional years to get a Ph.D. degree and I am curious about new technologies, and willing to learn them.** Followings is my CV and you can also download one in [PDF]() format.\r\n\r\n###EDUCATION\r\n[Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](http://english.bupt.edu.cn/) (BUPT), Beijing, China        \r\n [International School](http://www.is.bupt.cn/)  Supported by [Queen Mary, University of London](http://www.qmul.ac.uk/)&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; _Sept 2012-present_        \r\n* Major: Telecommunications Engineering with Management\r\n* Overall GPA: 80.74/100\r\n\r\n### PUBLICATIONS  \r\n* **Yining Teng**, Zhang Lanshan, Ye Tian and Xiang Li, “A Novel FAHP Based Book Recommendation Method by Fusing Apriori Rule Mining”, **Accepted** by **The 10th International Conference on Intelligent Systems and Knowledge Engineering** (Ei Compendex).\r\n* Yang Yunjuan, Ye Tian, Edith C.-H.

In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
