{"name":"Yining Teng","tagline":"","body":"###Welcome       \r\nI am an undergraduate student of [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](http://english.bupt.edu.cn/) (BUPT). I am a self-motivated student with research experience and a solid background in programming. My research interests include but not limit to: _data mining, machine learning, business analytics, recommendation system, privacy issue, social network, incentive strategy and participatory sensing_. **I believe that it is worthwhile to spend additional years to pursue further study of these areas, and I am curious about new technologies and willing to learn them.** Followings is my CV, and you can also download my [CV](https://github.com/ynteng/CV/raw/master/CV_ynteng.pdf), [transcript](https://github.com/ynteng/CV/raw/master/transcript_ynteng.pdf), [selected publication](https://github.com/ynteng/CV/raw/master/publication_ISKE2015.pdf) or [all the files](https://github.com/ynteng/CV/zipball/master).     \r\n\r\n\r\n###EDUCATION\r\n[Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](http://english.bupt.edu.cn/) (BUPT), Beijing, China  &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; _Sept 2012-present_        \r\n* Major: Telecommunications Engineering with Management\r\n* Overall GPA: 81.10/100  (includes 65 courses with 157.2 credits)       \r\n* Major GPA: 83.28/100 (includes 26 courses about CS and mathematics with 79 credits, such as JAVA, software engineering, data mining, AI, advanced mathematics and probability theory)    \r\n\r\n\r\n### PUBLICATIONS  \r\n* Ye Tian, Edith C.-H.
